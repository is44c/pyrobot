<h1>Experiments with a Self-Organizing Map</h1>

<hr>

The following experiments were performed using <a
href=../html/>Pyro</a>, part of a library for robotics and AI research
using Python. Source links can be found below. <p>

The goal of this test was to train a SOM on the pixels of an image, to
see how the SOM would self-organize the colors. <p>

First, we need an image, such as: <p>

<img src=stephbot.jpg> <p>

However, this image contains many pixels. To make this easier, let's
just take a portion of that image to train the SOM. So, selecting a
portion that appears to capture the full range of colors gives: <p>

<img src=stephbot-partial.jpg> <p>

Now, we need to decide how big, and what dimensions to make the SOM. I
decided that a 10 by 10 map will suffice. Each pixel was represented
as an RGB color triplet.<p>

I'm not sure what type of function to use in updating the weights, so
I made up one based on the "mexican hat" function. I used Euclidian
distance rather than hexagonal or grid, with a shrinking radius over
the course of the run. <p>

To speed things up, I only did a run of 10 steps. To see how the map
is forming, I redisplay the larger picture. However, instead of
plotting the regular RGB color pixel, I use the SOM to classify the
color triplet, and then plot the classification as a color. <p>

The classification color is determined by its position on the map. As
there are two dimensions to the map, I made one dimension be the amout
of red, and the other be the amout of green. <p>

Each SOM image (on left) is shown next to the original (on right). <p>

Step 1: <p>

<img src=som-1.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

This may be most recognizable picture in the set. But notice that
there is a fair amout of yellow, which is the center of the map.<p>

Step 2: <p>

<img src=som-2.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

This next step pushes the classifications more to the corners (pure
red and pure green). <p>

Step 3: <p>

<img src=som-3.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

Now, some yellow enters back into the classifications.<p>

Step 4: <p>

<img src=som-4.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

Step 5: <p>

<img src=som-5.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

Step 6: <p>

<img src=som-6.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

Step 7: <p>

<img src=som-7.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

Step 8: <p>

<img src=som-8.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

Step 9: <p>

<img src=som-9.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>

Step 10: <p>

<img src=som-10.gif>
<img src=stephbot2.jpg> <p>
