1. Getting Started

Linux, Python, X

1.1. Checklist

a. Is the pyro environment variable defined?

After your system administrator has installed Pyro, you need to make
sure that you can run it.

% env | grep PYRO

If you see something like:

PYRO=/usr/local/pyro

then your are ready for the next test. If you didn't see something
like the above, then you will need to define the PYRO environment
variable. You do that with the following command:

% export PYRO=/usr/local/pyro

if /usr/local/pyro is where Pyro is installed.

b. Is pyro in your path?

Now, if you type:

% pyro

at the command prompt, a graphics window should appear. If not, you
will need to issue:

% export PATH=$PATH:$PYRO/bin

Then you should be able to run the Pyro program. If it does not work,
or gives an error, please tell your systems administrator to see the
Pyro Developers Manual.
