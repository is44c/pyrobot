1. collect.py -> camera.dat  motors.dat  poses.dat  sonar.dat (120 minutes)
2. somtrain.py   -> camera.cod (50 minutes) sonar.cod (3 minutes)
3. ffprepare.py -> fftargets.dat ffinputs.dat (1 minute)
4. fftrain.py -> ff.wts 

Support Programs:

ffBrain.py - controls trained robot with fixed goal
plotBrain.py - samples env space, creating flow.dat with x,y,angle
tools/trace.py -> default.ppm

exp00

Tried 1-step movement paths. Did not train to stop. It performed very
well in avoiding obstacles. Noise at default value. Goals were sonar
and vision soms. 15 hids.

exp01

Extended paths to 10-steps. Learned up to 60%. Not very good at
obstacle avoiding. Had noise at default value. Goals were sonar and
vision soms. 15 hids.

exp02

Trained 10-step measures, with 5 steps overlap. First tried ortho reps
from som. Learned up to about 50%. Then added activation spread in som
reps. Learned up to 48%. No noise in training or testing. Goal was
just vision som. 30 hids.

exp03

Changed goal back to both sonar and vision soms. Hids 15.
